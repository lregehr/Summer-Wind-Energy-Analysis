This project analyzes Wind Energy Tolerance (TI) in Iowa counties by combining U.S. Census demographic data with wind ordinance data. It cleans and merges datasets and uses regression models in Python to explore how socioeconomic and geographic factors relate to community tolerance for wind energy.
